## Problem
Which of the choices below is the title of a movie from the year 2013 that is rated PG-13 and won no awards? Please query the video.movieDetails collection to find the answer.

NOTE: There is a dump of the video database included in the handouts for the "Creating Documents" lesson. Use that data set to answer this question.

## Solution

### Things to remember
Utility mongorestore allows you to load data into the database. It requires a file (dump) that contains a BSON . Such a file can be created using different tools mongodump.

mongorestore -d db_name -c collection_name path/file.bson

Incase only for a single collection.Try this:
mongorestore --drop -d db_name -c collection_name path/file.bson

For restoring the complete folder exported by mongodump:
mongorestore -d db_name path/

The second utility mongoimport allows you to import data from files in JSON, CSV or TSV. Better if the data file is created with the help mongoexport , though potentially possible to use other generators. 
Dump created with mongoexport not preserve typing, so you need to use it with the use of head and already working on databases better think twice.

mongoimport --drop -d db_name -c collection_name path/file.json

###Importing movieDetails file
mongorestore -d video -c movieDetails movieDetails.bson

###Finding the title of necessary movies - sorted alphabetically
> db.movieDetails.find({'rated':'PG-13','awards.wins':0},{'title':1,'_id':0}).pretty().sort({'title':1})
